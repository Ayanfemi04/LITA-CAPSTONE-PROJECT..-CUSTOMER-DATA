The cleaning process was one of the most important aspect of this project as it eliminated duplicate that could bring inadequacies or errors into my analysis.
   
    *Microsoft Excel
I ensure the data was cleaned by checking for duplicate rows by selecting the table, navigating to the data tab and clicking on “Remove Duplicates”, to remove duplicates.
This will help in carrying out a proper and detailed analysis. all these were done to make the data clean and ready for analysis.
   
    *  POWER BI
I loaded the Clean Data Set into PowerBI for the further analysis and Visualization in order to answer business questions and meet up with objectives.

    *SQL(STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE)
 I used this tool to query the database in a number of ways, using English-like statements. i also used it to store and manage data in Relational
Database Management System (RDBMS).

    *GITHUB
    This is used as a tool for portfolio building.
