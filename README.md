## PROJECT OVERVIEW
---
This project aims at providing insights into a customer data set which includes subscription trends and behavior to support strategic decision-making, The analysis will dive into understanding subscription patterns, cancellation trends, and top-performing subscription types, regional breakdowns of customer activity. The goal is to enable the company to make data-driven decisions that improve customer satisfaction, and drive revenue growth. 

### DATA INFORMATION
---
The data set was retrieved from an open source. It shows the record of the Subscription data of a set of customer over a period of time, it comprises of columns and rows. The columns names are: Customer ID,Customer name,Region, Subscription type, subscription date, subscription end, canceled and Revenue.

#### DATA CLEANING AND TOOLS USED
---
The cleaning process was one of the most important aspect of this project as it eliminated duplicate that could bring inadequacies or errors into my analysis.
   
    *Microsoft Excel
I ensure the data was cleaned by checking for duplicate rows by selecting the table, navigating to the data tab and clicking on “Remove Duplicates”, to remove duplicates.
This will help in carrying out a proper and detailed analysis. all these were done to make the data clean and ready for analysis.
   
    *  POWER BI
I loaded the Clean Data Set into PowerBI for the further analysis and Visualization in order to answer business questions and meet up with objectives.

    *SQL(STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE)
 I used this tool to query the database in a number of ways, using English-like statements. i also used it to store and manage data in Relational
Database Management System (RDBMS).

    *GITHUB
    This is used as a tool for portfolio building.

#### EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS
---
The EDA involves the following key questions;

    -What is the total number of customers from each region?
    -Which is the most popular subscription type by the number of customers?
    -How many customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months?
    What is the average subscription duration for all customers.

#### DATA VISUALISATION

With the use of a Pivot  Table i was able to summarize and also have a deep insight into total revenue generated by each region.
From the analysis, i was able to deduce that the Region with the highest Revenue is the Southern Region, with a total revenue of #37,580,782. Followed by the Western Region with a total Revenue of #37,482,120. The Eastern Region, also recorded a total revenue of #37,387,894.

####   CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
From the analysis, we were able to summarize the total revenue generated based on the subscription type. the Basic type of subscription has a Total Revenue of #29,843,597 , hence, the with the largest number of subscriber. followed by Premium with a total of  #15,051,884 and Standard with a total of #15, 021,236.
   Hence the Service Providers should;
   
   * Create necessary awareness( most especially in regions where low sales are recorded), about the subscrption types they offer, stating the benefits attached to them.
   * give discounted rates, incentives to new customers
   * introduce impactful and educational programmes that can positively influence their viewers.
   
   




    








#### DATA ANALYSIS

I used some basic lines of code, queries, Dax functions in the course of this Analysis. Some of which are;

```SQL
